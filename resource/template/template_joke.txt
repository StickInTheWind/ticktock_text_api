let me tell you something, I never make the same mistake twice. I make it five and six times, just to be sure.
let me tell you something, Do not argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.
let me tell you something, We live in a society where pizza gets to your house before the police.
let me tell you something, Politicians and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason.
let me tell you something, We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public.
let me tell you a joke, A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to get married?" Father replied, "I don't know son, I'm still paying."
