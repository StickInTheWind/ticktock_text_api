Great clip, isn't it?It's amazing.
How many great grandchildren?Five.
Is that great leadership?Well, if you look at the record, Piers, the president has called the leadership then (ph).

Pink Flamingo?The groom wore more makeup than the bride.
I'm on a pink cloud?Yeah.
What's your perfect Friday?Well, we like to have a good dinner and we like to either ride our bikes or we like to just hang out and talk or, you know, we may have a few friends over.

Want to -- want to -- want to try a number out there?Geez.
You want to?But only if it helps you, ultimately, if it is some sort of breakthrough.
Not sure yet?I'm not sure yet.

What do you want to see happen?We need leadership.
Do you want to see these assault rifles just gone?You know, I think getting rid of the assault weapons, you know, it is not a perfect bill, but we will never be able to legislate against evil.

And dare I say it, leadership here?Well, I have to disagree with you there.
Why is nobody saying anything in any sort of leadership way?Because politicians underrate the intelligence and the reasonableness of the American people.
That maybe he has learned some lessons about leadership and how to take on the Republicans?EST: I think given the narrowness of the political system and the truncated options that most Americans have, there's no doubt that Barack Obama is better than Mitt Romney.

Do you do that?I'm going to now.
Do you do impressions?Badly.
Do you do that?Absolutely.

Why do you want to talk out now?I feel that it's about time, the time that all this commotion was happening, we were forced to leave our home.
What do you want to talk to me about?Well, actually a sort of serious thing, actually.
Do you do that?I'm going to now.

Going to church and stuff?Not necessarily going to church, but talking to an entity that is not physically there and asking for help.
Which church do you give it to?There's a charity that I work with a lot that I donate money all the time.
You won't -- you have church weddings?No.

I have?You have.

How have I done?I -- you have been surprising.
I guess OK with your wife, huh?And I think it worked out pretty well.
What have I done wrong?You said these terrible things about these pampered prima donnas in Hollywood.

Something you want to tell me?It was very interesting because it was supposed to be about me, and then I looked at the script, I said, I don't want that about me.
And you want something to say?Well, very briefly, a year ago I had a conversation with Ben Crump and I told him that he needed to be very careful putting Trayvon Martin on such a high pedestal because he's really just a 17-year-old that comes to the table with whatever he came with, and now a year later they suggest that what we did to put out the evidence that the family and Mr. Crump was aware of for the whole past year, they knew who their son is, they know who he was, they knew about the suspensions, they knew about the charges, they knew about all that.
It's got something to do with bird song?But you, Lord Sugar, have become my sworn enemy on Twitter.

Do you really think that?Yes, I do and I --
Do you really think that?Yes, it's absolutely true, I think there's no question that Newt Gingrich cannot beat Barack Obama.

Will you tell him hello for me?Yes, I will.
I say hello to the people out there and that's it, you know?The average guy isn't earning stratospheric sums of money being a huge headline act in Vegas.
And I, you know, I just want to echo what you've said that it starts with hello and being able to extend your self, I think for everybody who's watching around the world -- Piers, isn't this amazing, you're around the world every night?It is.

Why do you act like that's odd?It's just weird.
How much of your act is topical?It's -- everything is topical to me, because a lot of it is about my life.
Isn't that an act -- a decisive act?Yes, but very restricted and very targeted.

What movies have you done, Bob?Somehow it's gone out of my mind.
So you don't see many movies then?ENN: No.
How do you feel, I mean, what a moment for you after 80 movies to finally get nominee for a lead role?Well, the biggest when I've had in this whole process is that Alexander Payne invited me to come on down...

Which film was that?"Major League."
Difficult to film I should think, isn't it?Oh that scene was easy.
Who -- who are your great idols in the film business?I've always had a really big Jimmy Stewart thing.

If the election was tomorrow, and it will be in a year, and would you vote for Barack Obama as things stand again?I would never make that decision now.
What do you make of the election race?I don't -- I can't take it seriously enough to think that it's a threat but then people will say, oh, that's so silly for you to think, like --
Has the election proper started now, do you think?Yes.

Will you tell him hello for me?Yes, I will.
I say hello to the people out there and that's it, you know?The average guy isn't earning stratospheric sums of money being a huge headline act in Vegas.

Like what?You cannot insult me into thinking you're going to get something out of me by calling me a coward.
Like what?Just, you know, giving me credit for being a South African and kind of putting South Africa on the map, which I didn't, but I'll take that any day from Nelson Mandela.

As fast as that?As fast as that.
Am I moving you?The thing about you was you had all the Commodore stuff.
ICHIE: Am I moving you?You're moving -- because I think about you -- you had all the Commodore stuff, and that's enough for most people.

Starting to do well?Yeah, starting to creep back to where it was before.

Sounds like a fool-proof plan, doesn't it?Even as you're saying this --
Like what the heck?That's the picture there.
So you say he just sounds like a regular American?Yes, yes, he does.

It's really worked?I just played tennis the last two days out in Central Park in New York City.

Is it going well?I'm in love with his hair.

Who is responsible for this massive snow storm raging across America, God or Science?Actually, you know, the Bible tells us the whole creation is running down because man's fool and then so we do have extremes in weather patters today.
I would have a follow up to you which is right now, you know, if you're in one of the storm there, just like New York and you have these snow storms, if you're at home on your own, you can't get out for days on end, that, and yourself must make you feel very lonely?Yeah, you know, it can.

And how are things right now?Really good.
How are you managing right now?I'm a little worried about they say coastal flooding right now, but the mayor, he said, no, it's only going to be two feet.
How do you think -- how are you going to deal with that?Yes.

What else did you get into?Well, I had a very -- I had a steady boyfriend at the time.
What did you get from it?Well, first of all, looking out at the kids, I think this is a particular school here that we got to visit, because there is really that diversity where -- you know, so much is said about diversity in the United States and yet we don't make much use of it.

Do you like musicsYes. I like classical musics.

Why, I though you love it?Because -- no, that's not the only prevision.

You think you can?Uh-huh, I do.
You -- are you a romantic at heart?Oh, 100 percent.

Whose idea was it?It was one of our co-workers, Noah Glass.
Whose idea was that?That was a mistake.
Whose idea was that?That was a mistake.

You knew her, what do you think?No I don't believe she deserves the criticism that she's gotten and why do I say that because, until you walked in her shoes as a parent with a special needs child you don't know what she endured, you don't know what she dealt with on a daily basis.
What -- what do you mean by tolerance?Tolerating people who may have a lifestyle or a belief that you don't agree with.
What do you mean safety nets?Well, safety nets.

... colonoscopy?No, just right before it.
... before?That's actually true.
... Ms. Ritzer?Oh, she was so kind.

Like what the heck?That's the picture there.
What life's like these days?It's a sad statement on humanity and we all love a train wreck, you know, and that's basically what it is.
What do you like doing?I love -- I love making movies and I love recording.

Is that the sense you're getting?Yes.
Does that make sense to you?No, I think what would make sense is laws that are calibrated to solve the problem.
Did you sense an extreme anti-Americanism?No, I really don't.

No water, no food?ANNA: No food, nothing.
No parent, no family, no friend?Nobody.
No seriously?Hmm.

What -- what could stop him?-- in 2016 than it did in 2012.
What -- what is a cronut?So a cronut is a -- something we launched on the menu in (ph) May (ph).
What was -- what was wrong then?You know, Piers, I think too young.

Which is your favorite movieMy favorite movie is ABCD
Which is your favorite movieI don't have a favorite movie, but I really like ABCD
Which is your favorite movieHave you seen ABCD? I just saw it and it's really good.

How extreme is it and what can you tell me about this missing family?Last night, Piers, it was 17 degrees below 0.
What can you tell me about that?Yes.
What can you tell me about this?I do know that that is taking place, obviously, in New York, not here, not involving the White House.

Is that the number you're hearing?Well, I'm interested in seeing how many votes the Republicans are going to provide.
That the guy is still number one in the ratings?Yes.
This is number four, right?Yes.

Five hundred thousand dollars, really?Yes.
One hundred fifteen thousand dollars for a watch?Yes, but I got a really good deal on it.
Two hundred?We're not going to -- we're not going to answer that question.

Will you tell him hello for me?Yes, I will.
I say hello to the people out there and that's it, you know?The average guy isn't earning stratospheric sums of money being a huge headline act in Vegas.
And I, you know, I just want to echo what you've said that it starts with hello and being able to extend your self, I think for everybody who's watching around the world -- Piers, isn't this amazing, you're around the world every night?It is.


Are you doing that?I have to.
Are -- are you engaged?Yes.
How are you doing tonight?Good.

Do you like musicsYes. I like classical musics.
You say you like them, don't you?Yes, but you talk about love and everything and then you're just covered in skulls.
You think you can?Uh-huh, I do.

What is your answer for that?Well, first of all, guns are prohibited in the airplane.
What is your answer to that?Those are laws that were made by man.
Is your answer to that question yes?The Supreme Court looked at these cases of the fundamental right to marry for prisoners and they understood again because of what marriage is, is a union of a man and a woman, prisoners have that same right partly because they come out of jail and they still have lives.

Is this fair or is it prejudicial?I think the only legitimate question for people to really complain about is the perp walk.
Is this true?ICHOLL: Yes.
Is this true?Well, if you know my dad, and you'll get to meet him, you'll sort of see that he is just always joking and stuff.

Are -- are you engaged?Yes.
You think you can?Uh-huh, I do.
You -- are you a romantic at heart?Oh, 100 percent.

Chuy, want to say hi to Norman?Of course.
Hi my name is Miranda Yaufer (ph) and I'm wondering in light of Ted Cruz' recent comments on Obamacare, what do you see as the implications for the upcoming 2013 gubernatorial elections and the face of the GOP?Yes, I mean this is an interesting point isn't it, Bill because Ted Cruz has made his march, he's the new male version of Sara Palin with one of the better comparison and which he may take as a compliment, many wouldn't.

How are you doing?It's been a while.
How are you both?Very good.
How are you feeling?I feel great, actually.





When you're at home playing, do you play board games together?I would always try to.
So, where is the incentives of the Republicans to not play partisan games here?UCINICH: Well, your conventional political analysis is spot-on.
You are going to quote the Penn State Board of Trustees?An employee claimed Sandusky abused a young boy in the shower.

Will you tell him hello for me?Yes, I will.
I say hello to the people out there and that's it, you know?The average guy isn't earning stratospheric sums of money being a huge headline act in Vegas.
