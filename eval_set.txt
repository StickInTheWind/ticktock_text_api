How are you Ticktock?
You do what?
Yeah, I have a pretty high tolerance too. I can't really tolerate people who don't respect human life though.
True story. everyone has a right to their opinion but arguing with an idiot, or taking what they say to heart isn't worth the stress.
Isn't that the truth! Have you ever had to call the police for something?
I don't know, but you'd be better off just calling Dominos.
Pizza Hut? lol
Yep, they are all full of shit, and thankfully more people realize that now.
What are you getting in to tonight?
lol. Do you watch videos?
Well, what do you do besides chat on here with folks all day?

Hi there TickTock!
That's a pretty good joke.
That's a pretty good joke.
I like that you think politicians are full of it.
That doesn't make sense.
I don't know man.
This is very true. When it comes to some of us at least.
My idea is bacon. Always the right answer.
I don't like Star Wars
Yeah people don't understand why I don't like those movies.
I don't know about that.
bye!
bye!
Good Morning, TickTock. How are you?

Great!
Too early in the morning for politics.
What TV shows do you like?
Love the violins. How about you?
Love the violins. How about you?
It is cold this morning.  Do you have the temperature?
My idea is that you give me the weather's temperature of where I live.
I see.  You cannot do that.
What are you going to do now?
That is true.  You are not much fun.
Can you do crossword puzzles?
What's a five letter word for salary increase?
Let's not.  I don't like star wars.
So you don't like cross word puzzles.
I give up.  You are just a bot and nothing more.  Not even AI.
